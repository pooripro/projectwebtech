                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">A tank is an armoured fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat.<br> Tanks have heavy
                    firepower,
                    strong armour, and good battlefield manoeuvrability<br> provided by tracks and a powerful engine;
                    usually their main armament is <br> mounted in a turret. They are a mainstay of modern 20th and 21st
                    century<br>ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat. </p>
                <h1>AT THE START</h1>
                <p>The history of the tank began in World War I, when armoured all-terrain fighting vehicles were first
                    deployed as a response to the problems of trench warfare, ushering in a new era of mechanized
                    warfare. Though initially crude and unreliable, tanks eventually became a mainstay of ground armies.
                    By World War II, tank design had advanced significantly, and tanks were used in quantity in all land
                    theatres of the war. The Cold War saw the rise of modern tank doctrine and the rise of the
                    general-purpose main battle tank. The tank still provides the backbone to land combat operations in
                    the 21st century.</p>
